🏭 Gold Recovery Prediction Model (Zyfra Prototype)

📌 Project Overview

This project develops a prototype machine-learning model for Zyfra, a company specializing in industrial efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model predicts the amount of gold recovered from gold ore using process data from the extraction and purification stages.

Accurate prediction of gold recovery helps eliminate unprofitable processing configurations, improve operational decision-making, and support optimization of the production pipeline.
